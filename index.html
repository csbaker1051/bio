    <h3>The Story (Short and Semi-Sweet Edition):</h3>
    <p1>
        Hi, my name is Cody. I am a 31 year old nurse living in St. Louis, a father to a 9 year old son, and I have completely lost my mind .... let me explain. <br>
        I have been in healthcare since 2009, starting as a dialysis technician, then eventually making the short (but painful) journey through nursing school. <br>
        Now, 12 years, 1 divorce, and even a small detour of joing the military later, I have decided to scrap my decade long career for a whole new, and totally<br>
        different one! So, apperently, I've had some neurons cease to fire correctly.

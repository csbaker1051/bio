        <p1 class="bio">Hi, my name is Cody. I am a 31 year old nurse living in St. Louis, a father to a 9 year old son, and I have completely lost my mind .... let me explain.
        I have been in healthcare since 2009, starting as a dialysis technician, then eventually making the short (but painful) journey through nursing school.
        Now, 12 years, 1 divorce, and even a small detour of joing the military later, I have decided to scrap my decade long career for a whole new, and totally
        different one! So, apperently, I've had some neurons cease to fire correctly.</p1>
